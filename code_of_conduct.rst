London Django Meetup Code of Conduct
====================================

Be awesome to each other
------------------------

The London Django Meetup Group aims to provide fun, welcoming and professional
environments so that diverse groups of peopleÂ­- regardless of age, race, gender
identity or expression, background, disability, appearance, sexuality, walk of
life, or religion - can get together to learn from and be inspired by each
other about all things related to Django, the high-level Python Web framework.

    Not sure if we should write a 'Values Statement' - what are your thoughts?

The London Django Meetup Group is committed to the ideals expressed in our
Values Statement and ask all our members, speakers, volunteers, attendees and
guests to adopt these principles. We are a diverse community. Sometimes this
means we need to work harder to ensure we're creating an environment of trust
and respect where all who come to participate feel comfortable and included. We
value your participation and appreciate your help in realising this goal.

Be respectful
.............

Respect yourself, and respect others. Be courteous to those around you. If
someone indicates they don't wish to be photographed, respect that wish. If
someone indicates they would like to be left alone, let them be. Our meetup
venues and online spaces may be shared with members of the public; please be
considerate to all patrons of these locations.

Be inclusive
............

All presentation material should be suitable for people aged 12 and above. All
public presentations are subject to this code of conduct and thus may not
contain:

- sexual or violent imagery
- exclusionary language
- language which is not appropriate for an all-ages audience

For the avoidance of doubt, public presentations, include but are not limited
to keynotes, presentations, lightning talks, addresses, IRC, mailing list posts
and forums. If you are in doubt, consider it covered.

If presenters are unsure whether their material is suitable, they are
encouraged to show it to the meetup host or a meetup organiser before their
session.

Be aware
........

We ask everyone to be aware that we will not tolerate intimidation, harassment,
or any abusive, discriminatory or derogatory behaviour by anyone at any event
or online. Complaints can be made to the `meetup organisers
<http://www.meetup.com/The-London-Django-Meetup-Group/members/?op=leaders>`_
either face to face at a meetup, or via the Meetup website. All complaints
made to event organisers will remain confidential and be taken seriously. The
complaint will be treated appropriately with discretion. Should event
organiser consider it appropriate, measures they may take include:

- being told to apologise
- being told to stop/modify their behaviour appropriately
- being warned that enforcement action may be taken if the behaviour continues
- being asked to leave the venue immediately
- be prohibited from continuing to attend the event
- have the incident reported to the appropriate authorities

What does that mean for me?
...........................

All participants, including event attendees and speakers must not engage in any
intimidation, harassment, or abusive or discriminatory behaviour. Here are some
examples of behaviours which are not appropriate:

- offensive verbal or written remarks related to gender, sexual orientation,
  disability, physical appearance, body size, race or religion
- sexual or violent images in public spaces (including presentation slides)
- deliberate intimidation
- stalking or following
- unwanted photography or recording
- sustained disruption of talks or other events
- intoxication at an event venue
- inappropriate physical contact
- unwelcome sexual attention
- sexist, racist, or other exclusionary jokes
- unwarranted exclusion from conference or related events based on age, gender,
  sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race or
  religion.

**We want everyone to have a good time at our events**
