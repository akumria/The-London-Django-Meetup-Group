## Talks

### Django Performance Recipes - Jon Atkinson

> I've written a lot of Django code in my career, some slow, and some fast; my
> aim is to share a few of the techniques you can use to go from 300ms response
> times to 30ms. We'll travel up and down the stack, looking to identify,
> monitor and solve performance issues, while dodging those which just aren't
> worth solving.
