### Intro to Paperless - Daniel Quinn

> After fighting with the process of applying for a UK visa and starting a
> company here, I wrote Paperless to help deal with the antiquated process of
> archiving probably-useless-but-just-maybe- useful documents using a simple
> documents scanner, Django, and a bunch of other handy utilities. The result
> is a web-based, self-hosted archive for all of your paper stuff. Scan it and
> shred it, you never need to deal with paper again.
