## About

September is here already and the rain is going to be crappy. But we can keep
you toasty warm with some lovely Django talks this month. After the talks we'll
head over to a nearby pub to ponder learnings and share tales of Django.

## 15 Minute Talks

### Jon Atkinson: "Django Performance Recipes"

> I've written a lot of Django code in my career, some slow, and some fast; my
> aim is to share a few of the techniques you can use to go from 300ms response
> times to 30ms. We'll travel up and down the stack, looking to identify,
> monitor and solve performance issues, while dodging those which just aren't
> worth solving.
